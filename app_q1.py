This module aims at answering to a problem asked in a probability & statistics
course from the Polytechnic School of Louvain (LFSAB1105 Probability and 
Statistics, by Donatien Hainaut and Rainer Von Sachs). Whenever we reference a
book, it is the reference book of the course :
Mathematical statistics with applications. Wackerly, Mendenhall, Scheaffer.

This module provides functions to compute some basic quantities over 
arbitrary large samples, (like the mean, the variances, and quantiles) for 
single variable probabilities, to generate pseudo-random numbers following 
exponential and gamma distributions, and many plot and printing utilities.

This module needs Python 3.5+ to run
